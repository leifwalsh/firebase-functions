Hi {{firstName}}!

Thank you again for volunteering to help our neighbors.

**We've assigned you Route {{routeName}} with the following tickets. We've
listed your tickets in delivery order: {{ticketIDs}}**

**Please arrive at Brooklyn Packers this Saturday, {{deliveryDateString}} at
{{arrivalTime}}.**

Check out the instructions below. If any issues come up day-of, contact this
week's Dispatcher: Annika at {{warehouseCoordinatorPhone1}}. Please also contact
us ASAP if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to someone
who has. As always, volunteers should wear masks and sanitize their hands
between deliveries.

### Saturday Volunteer Instructions

We recommend printing this if you can---it helps to mark off tasks as they are
completed!

- [ ] **Come to Brooklyn Packers warehouse for pre-packed groceries at
      {{arrivalTime}}.** [221 Glenmore Ave, Gate 3, Brooklyn, NY
      11207]({{{warehouseMapsUrl}}})
      - [ ] Find a spot to park **(please do not park in front of the main
            driveway)**.
      - [ ] Come to the warehouse and let us know you've arrived **(Please
            observe social distancing at the warehouse, and only send one
            person per delivery team to check in)**; the on-site coordinator
            will give additional information and answer any questions you might
            have.
      - [ ] Hold tight - we'll let you know when your items are ready.
- [ ] **While you're waiting**, call the recipients of each ticket to confirm
      that someone will be home to accept the delivery. **If you can't reach
      them**, let the dispatcher know and proceed with delivery. **If you reach
      them but they won't be home**, let the dispatcher know and we will use
      their groceries for someone else and deliver to them another time. 
- [ ] **When your items are ready**, pull up closer and we'll bring the pallet
      to your car. You'll be given the following for each ticket (these are
      provided at the warehouse and do not need to be purchased):
      - [ ] Meat
      - [ ] Dessert
      - [ ] Holiday sides (rolls, gravy, beans, etc.)
      - [ ] Fresh produce box
- [ ] **Please confirm that the ticket IDs on every box and bag** match your
      route number/name (ex. RTE 6).
- [ ] **Load up your car.** We recommend arranging them by route, so the first
      stop is the most accessible.
- [ ] **Make your deliveries and check off each one as you complete it.** If a
      neighbor gives you a donation, please accept it with gratitude! You can
      Venmo the amount to Bed-Stuy Strong (full information at
      [bedstuystrong.com](https://bedstuystrong.com)) and email
      [operations@bedstuystrong.com](mailto:operations@bedstuystrong.com) if you
      have any questions.
- [ ] **When you're done, fill out the [delivery completion
      form](https://airtable.com/shrqWwFVn2OUkjv77) so we know that you have
      delivered to all of the neighbors on your route.** Thank you!
